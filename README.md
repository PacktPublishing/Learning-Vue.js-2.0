## About the Video Course
		Vue.js is one of the latest JavaScript frameworks and has attracted the interest of web developers as it can be used to build complex single-page applications.
This video course shows developers how to build high-performing, reactive web interfaces with Vue.js. It starts from scratch, teaching you how to build a “Hello World!” application in Vue.js and moves towards building advanced applications step by step. You'll earn the concepts that you need to know about Vue.js. You'll build an application as you go, putting the concepts we've explained into practice. Several modern tools such as Webpack, vue-cli, hot reloading, and vue devtools will be used to develop modern web applications, focusing on the view layer to provide the most performant experience for users. Also, you will use the vue-cli-based Webpack template and look at how we can build on top of that starter kit.
By the end of this course, you will be able to build complex and large web applications with Vue.js and will also understand how to make single-file-based reusable components which can be used across projects.
